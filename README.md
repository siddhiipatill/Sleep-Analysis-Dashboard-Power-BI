# Sleep-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI
📊 Project Overview

The Sleep Analysis Dashboard provides a detailed overview of individuals’ sleep patterns, highlighting factors that influence sleep quality such as stress levels, BMI, and occupation.
This dashboard aims to identify trends and relationships between sleep disorders, average sleep hours, and lifestyle factors to promote better health insights.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze sleep quality across different age groups.

Compare sleep disorders like Insomnia and Sleep Apnea.

Evaluate correlations between stress levels and sleep quality.

Examine how BMI and occupation affect sleep duration and activity levels.

📈 Key Insights

Insomnia cases: 97 (20.68%) with an average sleep duration of 7.14 hours.

Sleep Apnea cases: 76 (16.20%) with an average sleep duration of 6.36 hours.

Overall Sleep Disorder prevalence: 36.89%.

Underweight and Obese individuals show lower sleep quality trends.

Office workers take fewer daily steps compared to manual laborers.
